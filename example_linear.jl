# simple example of the linear Reynolds equation, see Eq. (3) in
# Scaled boundary finite element method for hydrodynamic bearings in rotordynamic simulations
# Pfeil et al., International Journal of Mechanical Sciences 2021

# 
# This example should - except for slightly different boundary conditions - correspond to the one shown in Fig. 9a of the paper mentioned above. However, the linear version was only created for debugging purposes, and I haven't thoroughly verified this example.
